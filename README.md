# advent of code 2024

ðŸŽ„ This year I'm starting out with using it to learn Rust from scratch, so let's see how long it takes until I switch back to trusted old Python.

1. [Solution](https://github.com/alex-schaaf/adventofcode2024/blob/main/day01/src/main.rs). An easy start this year, which gave me a good opportunity to learn about `Vec` and `HashMap` data structures in Rust. I really like the `Option<T>` enum approach to handling optional values.
2. [Solution](https://github.com/alex-schaaf/adventofcode2024/blob/main/day02/src/main.rs). This one made me learn about cloning vectors, how to turn vectors into iterators, and anonymous functions. I got a bit stuck at first, as I was including 0 as an acceptable value when checking for the gradient monotony. Luckily writing some tests for my gradient monotony function got me to figure that out quickly!
    - Learnt about the `Vec::windows` method, that returns an iterator over a window of given size. So you can just `.map` over it using an anonymous diff function to calculate the gradient array.
